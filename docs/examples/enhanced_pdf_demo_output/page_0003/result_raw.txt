Recent developments. A promising alternative for pricing American options is the integral equation method, derived from decomposition formulas by [Peskir, 2005] (see also [Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis, 2011; Itkin, 2025; Andersen and Lake, 2024] and references therein). This approach offers significant computational advantages: solving the resulting integral equations can be substantially more efficient than using standard finite- difference methods. Furthermore, for models with a Gaussian kernel such as geometric Brownian motion, the Fast Gaussian Transform can be applied to compute the integral efficiently. This technique achieves linear complexity in the number of temporal nodes, even for multi- factor models, enabling fast and scalable pricing.

The integral equation approach has been further extended to handle dividend- paying assets in [Vellekoop and Andersen and Lake, 2024]. For example, Vellekoop and Nieuwenhuis generalize the decomposition formula to models with more general asset and cumulative dividend processes, uncovering new properties of the exercise boundary. However, a key challenge arises that computing the expectation of the early exercise premium (EEP) requires the transition density of the underlying process, which is generally unknown in closed form for many models, especially those that are time- inhomogeneous.

To address this, in this paper we propose several tractable alternatives for computing the option price, transition density, and early exercise boundary (EB). The latter can be efficiently determined using the GIT method, developed by the author and co- authors in a series of papers and comprehensively described in [Itkin, Lipton, and Muravey, 2021].

Note that a key practical decision is whether to model dividends as a fixed cash amount or a known proportion of the stock price. The fixed cash model is more common for mature companies but introduces the risk of negative prices. The proportional dividend model avoids this but may be less realistic for short- term, declared dividends. The choice significantly impacts the optimal exercise strategy and the resulting option price.

Despite this extensive literature, a consensus on a single optimal method remains elusive, as the choice is highly context- dependent. Key factors include the number and size of dividends, computational constraints, and the requirement to calibrate the model to market implied volatilities. For the purpose of generality, in this paper we consider a flexible hybrid dividend model that can simultaneously incorporate both discrete and continuous dividend representations or be reduced to either case.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the mathematical framework for pricing American options with hybrid dividends. We review the decomposition formula of [Peskir, 2005] and derive an integral equation for the American option price. In Section 3, we compute the European option price and transition density for a time- dependent geometric Brownian motion model with hybrid dividends. Section 4 derives a Volterra integral equation for the EB using the GIT method. We provide a rigorous treatment of the weak singularities inherent in such equations, including the known singularity in the EB's derivative at expiration. A change of variables is proposed to remove these singularities, ensuring robust numerical solutions. We also demonstrate that in the dividend- free limit, our equation reproduces well- known properties of the EB for American Calls and Puts. Section 5 discusses de- Americanization within our framework - the process of converting an American option price into an equivalent European option price with the same implied volatility. This transformation simplifies pricing and analysis, particularly when inferring local volatility from market prices of American options. We also explore an alternative approach based on the implied strike concept introduced in [Skabelin, 2015], and show that it offers greater computational efficiency. Section 6 presents numerical experiments comparing the performance of our method with the binomial tree across various scenarios. The final section concludes by discussing implications for both academics and practitioners and suggests directions for future research.
