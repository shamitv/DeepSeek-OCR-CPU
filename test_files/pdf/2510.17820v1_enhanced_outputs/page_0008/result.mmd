object would oscillate at the same frequency, and those for another object at a different frequency. This was touted as a neural mechanism to solve the "binding problem" [85]. Subsequent articles traced the root of those oscillations ultimately all the way back to the retina [86]. This raised some consternation in the retinal research community 7 because there had been hundreds of reports on retinal responses to moving objects, and very few of those mentioned any oscillations. Eventually these oscillations were found to be a side effect of anesthesia [87]. They don't occur in awake animals, and have nothing to do with the binding problem.  


All in all, the retina seems designed biologically to avoid ringing - despite the combination of high gain and feedback loops that might present risk factors for runaway oscillation. As a result, there really is no role for oscillations in the Standard Model of the retina.  


### 8.2 Fine-grained causality?  


Much of neuroscience is concerned with explaining psychological functions based on neural mechanisms. A predominant concern in this effort is the localization of function, such as "Brodmann area 17 is for low- level processing of visual images". With the advent of modern cell typing, one now reads fine- grained claims like "Cell type X in brain area Y implements behavioral function Z". There is little support for any such "microphenology" in the retina.  


For example, in the psychology of vision, "spatial contrast" and "color" are two very different stimulus attributes. But their processing within retinal circuitry is entirely intertwined. Horizontal cells carry signals for lateral inhibition, which sharpens spatial contrast. But the same neurons are also essential in the processing of color [50, 88, 89].  


On a local level within the circuit, the direction of causality isn't even well- defined. For example, the A2 amacrine cell drives cone ON- bipolar cells under dim light conditions, but gets driven by those neurons under bright conditions [90]. The prominence of feedback loops throughout the retina further complicates any assessment of which neurons lie upstream vs downstream.  


In summary, the retinal circuit simply functions as a whole, and one cannot usefully assign sub- functions to specific cell types. This may prove difficult in other brain regions as well.  


### 8.3 Detailed compartmental modeling?  


There is some enthusiasm in current neuroscience for treating the single neuron as a powerful processor in its own right, whose functions can only be understood through detailed models with hundreds of compartments harboring local nonlinearities [91]. The Standard Model largely treats retinal cells as single- compartment point neurons, meaning that a single activity variable is sufficient to describe the neuron's dynamics. This is not to say that all retinal neurons are electrotonically compact, in fact there is much evidence for local signaling within the axonal trees of bipolar cells, or the dendritic trees of amacrine and ganglion cells that is not shared with other parts of the neuron [37, 59, 92].  


Nonetheless, the point- neuron approximation made in the Standard Model accounts for most phenomena of interest. Take, for example, the most intensely debated example of retinal computation: direction- selectivity. Yes, there is evidence for spikes in the dendrites of direction- selective ganglion cells. Also, there may be a contribution from spatially ordered excitation and inhibition in the dendrites. Nonetheless, a large contributor to direction- selectivity is that the ganglion cell gets inhibition from starburst amacrines located on one side of its dendritic tree but not on the other [37]. In practice one can understand the phenomenon as arising from a spatially asymmetric circuit between point neurons, much as envisioned 60 years ago by the discoverers [75]. The lesson here is that, while single neurons may harbor prodigious computational capacity, that may not always be the way nature uses them. When faced with brain circuits whose function remains mysterious it may still pay off to start with simple point- neuron models.  


### 8.4 Low-dimensional neural dynamics?  


Another popular meme in current neuroscience is that underlying the responses of millions of neurons are just a few latent variables. After recording thousands of signals, one should therefore look to project them onto some low- dimensional manifold in which the truly important neural variables are represented [93]. Typically there are just two or three of these, which is fortuitously convenient, because we can then draw those manifolds on paper.  


In the case of the retina, this approach is obviously wrong. The human retina has a million neurons as outputs, and retinal circuitry is organized so that those million outputs report different things. For example, the receptive fields of neurons of the same type overlap only minimally, so they avoid redundant signaling. To good approximation, at every point in space there exists just one neuron of any given cell type. So there is no low- dimensional latent manifold hidden
